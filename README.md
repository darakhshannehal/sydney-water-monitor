## Sydney Beach Water Monitor

For #TidyTuesday – 2025-05-20 | Water Quality at Sydney Beaches (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-05-20/readme.md)

Shiny web application that enables users to assess **Enterococci** contamination risk at Sydney swim sites.  

Designed for public accessibility, the layout ensures clear interpretation of risk indicators.  

Currently, the dataset includes entries up to April 2025. This app has the potential to be dynamic—if data is sourced from an updated file or database, it will automatically load the newest dataset upon restart, ensuring real-time accuracy.  

Beyond pathogen monitoring, this framework can be adapted for real-time decision-making in public health, including climate change, environmental hazards, and epidemic intelligence.  

Deployment: shinyapps.io
